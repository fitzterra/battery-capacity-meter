Menu definition and manager

This module provides a menu function using the Menu class.

NOTE: Currently this is targeted for the SSD1306 type OLED displays, and more
      specifically the 128x64 size. It may work on other screens and sizes with
      some tweaking, but has only been tested on this type of display.
      Furthermore, it currently assume the font size is 8x8 as the standard
      Frame buffer provides.

The menu options and layout is defined using a hierarchical tuple definition
that can look like this:

.. python::

    MENU = (
        ('Item 1', Screen),
        ('Item 2', (
                     ('Sub 2.1', Screen),
                     ('Sub 2.2', Screen),
                     ('Sub 2.3', (
                                   ('Sub-sub 2.3.1', Screen),
                                   ('Sub-sub 2.3.2', Screen),
                                 )
                     ),
                   )
        ),
        ('Item 3', Screen),
        ('Item 4', Screen),
    )

Each entry is a 2-tuple with the first element being the menu entry to display,
and the second element a `ui_output.Screen` instance, or another tuple for a
sub-menu.

Notes and functionality:

* The menu entry name will be clipped to the max width the display can handle.
* Any one menu can be as long as it needs to be, and will scroll up and down it
  it does not fit on the screen.
* If the menu action (second menu definition element) is not a Screen type, it
  is assumed to be a sub-menu, and will have a '>' at the end of line to show
  this is a sub-menu.
* The currently selected item will be highlighted in reverse video.
* Control is currently only by rotary encoder and rotating clockwise will move
  down the menu, while rotating counter-clockwise will move up.
* Going past the top or bottom end will wrap around to the other end.
* Single click on the encoder button will action the currently selected item.
    * If this is a Screen instance, focus will be passed to this screen instance
    * If it is a tuple, it will be assumed to be a sub-menu definition and will
      jump into the sub-menu.
    * For any other type, and error will be logger.
* A long press of the encoder button will return to the parent menu from a
  sub-menu.
