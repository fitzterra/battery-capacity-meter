class Screen:
    """
    Generic OLED screen class.

    All UI screens should be inherited from this class.
    The main methods to override are:

    * `setup()` and `update()`:
        * These are the two output methods. `setup()` is called when initially
          receiving focus to do any initial display output setup.
        * The `update()` method could be called whenever the display needs to
          be updated.
        * Access to the display is via the `_display` attribute, which is
          in essence a FrameBuffer_ instance and uses the standard FB protocol.
        * After doing whatever updates to the FB is needed, the
          ._display.show()` method should be called to do the actual
          screen update.
        * NOTE: When this instance does NOT have focus, ._display` will be
          None, so if any weird errors happen, make sure this is not the
          reason.
    * The four ``act???()`` methods, or only those that will be needed.
        * These method are called asynchronously when user input is detected.
        * The current input types and methods called for these are:
            * `actCW()` : Rotary encoder turned one step clockwise
            * `actCCW()` : Rotary encoder turned one step counter clockwise
            * `actShort()`: The encoder button received a short press
            * `actLong()`: The encoder button received a long press
        * Any of these that are not needed do not need to be overridden.
        * These methods should normally do some screen updates and could call
          `update()`, or else just update the display directly.
        * These functions run inside an asyncio task, so should do whatever it
          needs to do quickly and then exit.
        * The `actShort()` will automatically pass focus to any Screen that was
          specified to "focus_on_exit" when this screen received focus. This
          removes the need to also override `actShort()` for every screen if a
          good chaining hierarchy is defined when passing focus.

    **Receiving Focus**

    When receiving focus via an external call to our `focus()` method, we get
    control of the display output and the user input.

    We also start a new asyncio task (`_inputMonitor`) to monitor for input and
    then call the appropriate action method. This monitor task will exit again
    when we loose focus.

    The caller that has passed focus to us, may also "suggest" another Screen
    instance that should get focus when this screen needs to exit. This can
    often be used by a Screen needing to show a  child screen. When passing
    focus to the child Screen, the parent will "suggest" to the child to return
    focus to itself when done.

    This is an easy way to create a dynamic hierarchical screen flow. A child
    may even pass focus to another child and then "suggest" to this child to
    pass focus back to this child's parent. All this without having to hardcode
    hierarchies in Screen instances.

            the screen. Based on the display height (``px_h``) and the font

        Passes focus on to another screen.

        Any function in this screen can pass the focus to another Screen
        instance via a call to this method.
        Passing the focus to another screen means that we stop monitoring for
        input events (see .run()`) and that we also do not have a display
        to send output to anymore.

        When this screen received focus via the `focus()` method, the caller
        may have "suggested" which Screen instance, it thinks, should receive
        focus when this instance exits or needs to pass focus back/forward.
        This "suggested" Screen instance would then be available in
        `_focus_on_exit`. These "suggestions" makes it easy to dynamically
        chain a hierarchical screen flow together.
        It is called a "suggestion" since it is up to the current screen to
        decide if it will use this suggestion, or pass focus to some other
        screen it would rather use, like a child of it's own, perhaps.

        Regardless, in order to pass focus to this "suggested" screen, you can
        either pass `_focus_on_exit` as the ``screen`` arg (if it is not
        None), or else just pass None for ``screen``.
        If the ``screen`` arg is None, we will assume that the
        `_focus_on_exit` attribute contains a valid screen, and use that
        as the screen to pass focus to here.

        If the assumption is wrong and the screen to receive focus turns out to
        be None, things will break and the developer will end with both pieces :-)

        Args:
            screen: Screen instance to pass focus to, or None to use
                `_focus_on_exit` as the screen to pass focus to. See above.
            return_to_me: If True, we will "suggest" to the screen we are
                passing focus to, to return focus back to us when it exists.
                All this does is pass ``self`` to the `focus()` call we are
                making to ``screen``.
