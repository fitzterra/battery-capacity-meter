"""
Battery Controller and State Machine module.

Module to control, monitor and keep track of the charge/discharging cycles for
a Li-Ion battery.

The charge and discharge currents, and battery voltage is monitored via one or
more ADS1115_ ADC modules.

The charging and discharging is managed by a TP4056_ BMS, for which the input
and output is switched from digital IO pins on the MCU (`Wemos S2 Mini`_ in this
case), via some MOSFETs.

class BatteryController(BCStateMachine):
    """
    A Battery Controller based on the `BCStateMachine` for managing and
    controlling these modules.

    A **BC** consists of the following:

    * Battery **Voltage** monitor:
        * This is a `VoltageMonitor` instance that monitors the battery voltage
          and also detects spikes in this voltage level, which are assumed to
          corresponds to the inserting or removing the battery - `_v_mon`.
    * Battery **Charging** control and monitor:
        * An IO Pin connected to the charge activation MOSFET (see the
          **Schematic** section in `config` for details). Setting this pin high
          switches the MOSFET on and starts the battery charging - `_pin_ch`.
        * A `ChargeMonitor` that monitors the charge current and amount of
          change for a given charge cycle - `_ch_mon`.
    * Battery **Discharging** control and monitor:
        * An IO Pin connected to the discharge activation MOSFET (see the
          **Schematic** section in `config` for details). Setting this pin high
          switches the MOSFET on and starts the battery discharging - `_pin_dch`.
        * A `ChargeMonitor` that monitors the discharge current and amount of
          change for a given charge cycle - `_dch_mon`.

    On instantiation, the monitor task (`ADCMonitor._monitor`) for each of the
    three ADC monitors will be created, but the charge/discharge monitors will
    both be paused, while only the voltage monitor will be running.

    Both charge and discharge switches will also be set off.

    As the three monitors described above sees changes in voltage or current,
    they will call back to internal functions (`_voltageSpike`, `_chargeSpike`,
    `_dischargeSpike`) which will then make a `transition()` call for the type
    of change event detected. This may change the controller state if the event
    is valid.

    Other external interfaces allows for other state changes - see `setID`,
    `charge`, `discharge`, `pause`, `resume`, `resetMetrics` and `reset` for
    more details.

    The current controller state can be checked by various other attributes and
    methods: `BCStateMachine.state`, `bat_v`, `bat_id`, `charge_vals`, `discharge_vals`.

    Attributes:

        _bc_prefix: Used as logging prefix to distinguish log messages by
            `BatteryController`
        _pin_ch: Charge control pin
        _pin_dch: Discharge control pin
        _bat_id: This will be the ID given to the battery currently being
            monitored by this controller.
        _v_mon: A `VoltageMonitor` as described above to monitor the battery
            voltage.
        _ch_mon: A `ChargeMonitor` as described above to monitor battery
            charging.
        _dch_mon: A `ChargeMonitor` as described above to monitor battery
            discharging.

        Instance initializer to set up a new `BatteryController` given the
        hardware config for it.

        The ``hw_conf`` argument is one of the elements from `HARDWARE_CFG` and
        describes the full config for one controller. See `HARDWARE_CFG` for more
        details on the structure.

        Each of the `VoltageMonitor`, and the two `ChargeMonitor` s that are set up
        will check the given ADC address against the available ADCs in
        `AVAILABLE_ADCS`. If the given address is not available, or the given
        channel is invalid, the monitor will be disabled.

        If any monitor is disabled, then the `BatteryController` instance's
        ``disable`` field will be ``True`` and the ``reason`` field will have a
        reason for being disabled. All other monitors for this controller will
        then also be set to disabled.

        As of now, we automatically set up spike detection on the
        `VoltageMonitor`, `_v_mon` only. We use the `V_SPIKE_TH` and
        `V_SPIKE_TH_T` spike threshold values from ``config.py`` - see
        `SpikeDetectCFG` for more info. The `_voltageSpike` callback will be
        called when voltage spikes (battery insert / remove) was detected.

        Note that asyncio monitor task for each of the monitors that are not
        disabled would also have been started, and will start running as soon
        as the asyncio scheduler starts running.
